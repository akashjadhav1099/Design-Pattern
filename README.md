Design patterns are the well provided solution of commonly occurring problems in software design.
Design patterns represent an idea.

Categorization Design Pattern:-
  1. Creational Desing Pattern
         Factory Pattern, Builder Pattern, Singleton Pattern
  2. Structural Design Pattern
         Proxy Pattern, Adaptor Pattern
  3. Behavioural Design Pattern
         Observer Pattern, State Pattern, Iterator Pattern


Factory Design Pattern:
  When There is SuperClass and multiple subclasses and we want to get object of subclasses based on input and requirement
  Then we create factory class which takes the responsibilty of creating object of class based on input
  Advantages:
    1. Focus on creating object for interface rather than implementation
    2. Loose coupling. more robust code
